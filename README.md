Fashion of the Gods
My art is my struggle. It was created in darkness. It was created during a struggle. It was created during a war. The war between good and evil. The war between good and good. I was fighting the enemy because I thought he was evil. I was fighting myself. I was fighting who I was born to be. Free. I was fighting freedom because I thought freedom was evil. For. I. Was. Foolish.
